Vendor library is of a similar analogous nature as putting passwords and other sensitive data to a `config` library and using gitignored files and `*.tmp.*` templates as there git-versioned placeholders.

More exactly, vendor library is for two kinds of things:

 - (buy) : third-party or copyrighted dependencies
 - (sell): the skins and company-owned specific files that you sold to a company and are not appropriate to become open-source

Put the **sell** things here!
